This paper is dedicated to the assessment of multistage hydraulic fracturing effectiveness in formations with low-permeability and high clay content.The paper demonstrates how the integrated logging suite supplemented with High-Definition Spectral Noise Logging tool can provide valuable information on the flowing reservoir zones behind the liner and therefore the multistage hydraulic fracturing effectiveness.Based on the results of logging survey carried out in flowing regime with nitrogen being injected into the well, the hydraulic fracturing job performance was assessed and the inflow intervals were identified. As a result of the multistage hydraulic fracturing job, incremental oil production was achieved.

This paper presents algorithms for processing data acquired by spectral noise logging (SNL) in memory mode. The SNL technology is designed to identify flowing reservoir intervals, cross-flows behind casing and tubing and casing leaks by spectral analysis of recorded noise signals.While moving through a reservoir, fluids and gases create turbulence and rock vibrations that in turn generate noise. This acoustic noise is recorded with a noise logging memory tool consisting of a high-sensitivity piezoelectric hydrophone sensor and an amplifier and data collection module. The tool records acoustic signals in the frequency range of 15 Hz to 60 kHz. The existing SNL technology excludes intense broadband noise created by the movement of the tool in the well.Useful information is extracted from background noise using a technique based on wavelet thresholding. Spectral noise density in the depth-frequency plane undergoes a wavelet transform. At each measurement depth, several tens of noise signals are recorded to determine mean wavelet coefficients and their typical variance. Then, they are analysed to remove statistically insignificant details from the signal spectrum and to suppress noise components that are present throughout large depth intervals.The processing of data acquired in tens of wells from various fields has show that the noise features identified by wavelet filtering correlate with open-hole data and are confirmed by conventional well logging techniques.}",

    abstract = "{Spectral Noise Logging (SNL) can provide information on reservoir flow units behind one or multiple barriers, which is beyond the spinner capability. The SNL tool is designed to record a high-resolution noise pattern in a wide frequency range, normally generated by fluid or gas flowing through porous media and the wellbore. Noise pattern recognition is critical to differentiate between formation flow and wellbore flow.SNL complements conventional production logging techniques by providing significant information that enhances reservoir flow characterisation. The tool design, data acquisition and advanced processing allow the location of active flow units and differentiation between flows through the reservoir matrix, fractures, high-permeability features, behind-casing channels and wellbore completion components.Thorough analysis of active flow streaks helps to monitor sweep efficiency and identify bypassed oil regions.Reservoir matrix flow noise remarkably correlates with porosity distribution. Therefore, it is an effective way to verify porosity and permeability models. This paper presents five field cases of SNL surveys performed during 2009–2011 in wells operated by Dubai Petroleum Establishment. These cases illustrate the allocation of injection by zone with rates below the spinner threshold, evaluation of the reliability of plugged perforations, and description of the behind pipe flow geometry. The paper also contains an introduction to SNL tool operation and noise data processing principles.}",

    abstract = "{The modern petroleum industry in Russian Federation has been lately focusing on developing fields with complex flow properties typical, for example, to low-permeability reservoirs. Therefore, it is important to identify flow zones in wells, mostly horizontal ones, when producing from such low-permeability reservoirs. This task is complicated not only by the effect of complex well completion components but also by the small specific rates of inflows into the wellbore. The conventional logging techniques do not always yield sufficient information under such conditions.This paper presents the results of a conventional downhole logging suite supplemented with High-Definition Spectral Noise Logging (SNL-HD) and targeted at determining flow profiles in low-rate horizontal producers. A separate objective was to evaluate the SNL-HD efficiency in identifying flow zones in low-permeability carbonate reservoirs. Upon SNL-HD data analysis, depth-specific broadband noises typical to turbulent flows from naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs into the wellbore were identified.The proposed technique is illustrated with four case studies performed in an oilfield situated in Krasnoyarsk Region in the south of the Evenk Municipal District. These cases studied dealing with the survey, results of which that application of SNL-HD in combination with the conventional downhole logging techniques helps to identify flow zones and thereby monitor horizontal well production and work out recommendations on well performance enhancement.}",

    abstract = "{The purpose of the report is to share with experts some of the accumulated experience in the planning and interpretation of thermohydrodynamic data of multilayer injection and production wells in combination with noise measurement.The description of the mathematical model of thermohydrodynamic processes in the system "wellbore – jointly operated reservoires", which takes into account convective heat transfer, thermal conductivity and barothermal effect in the reservoir, is given. The temperature model of the well takes into account the convective heat transfer, heat transfer with the environment. Annular flows and modify properties of wellbore zone are simulated.The article describes the geological properties, the technology of production well logging, mathematical models of thermohydrodynamic processes, algorithms of proccesses and quantitative data interpretation that tested in practice. Geological and technological measures to increase oil production are recommended based on the analysis of the results.The quantitative interpretation of thermohydrodynamic data based on the use of the simulator is demonstrated by the example of one injection well of SPD. There are results of production logging on several modes of injection and transient pressure and temperature.Production well logging (PL) was performed by several combined tools, such as different types of flowmeters, noise meter, temperature, pressure and composition sensors. The first research was carried out by a standard production logging unit, in the second case, an additional noise tool with fixed frequency windows was used, in the third one a broadband acoustic noise toll was used.The results of the interpretation of the standard production well logging, additional information on the noise data are analyzed. The temperature and pressure fields in the wellbore and in the reservoir are numerically simulated. As a result of the inverse problem solution, the contribution of each layer to total injection was determined, including the contribution of the overlapped tubing interval.The following results were obtained: The injectivity profile of the well at two different injection modes.Behind-the-casing flows of fluid above and below the perforated zone. A quantitative assessment of behind the casing flow contribution in two different injection modes is made.The location of casing leakage above the perforated zone is revealed, as well as a quantitative assessment of the contribution of fluid inflow from this location in two different modes of injection is made.The internal fluid circulation between the casing leakage point and the perforation zone is determined.As a result of simulating it was established: Behind-the-casing flow down is insignificant and repair and insulation works are not required.Behind-the-casing flow upwards is insignificant, but its effect is associated with long-term injection into an undeveloped formation. When the injection pressure decreases, this formation begins to push the perforated reservoir. Repair and insulation works are required.Thus, the combination of a standard production logging unit, acoustic noise measurement and simulation of thermohydrodynamic processes allowed to eliminate uncertainties in the interpretation of data and to give clear recommendations for repair and insulation works.}",

    abstract = "{Fiber optics has many applications in the oil and gas industry. In recent years, fiber optics has found usefulness in leak detection. The leaks can be efficiently identified using fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing measurement, thereby mitigating the health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risk associated with well integrity. Further, a production log can be used to gain more insight and finalize a way ahead to resolve well integrity issues.An innovative solution-driven approach was defined, with fiber-optic distributed measurement playing a key role. Multiple leaks were suspected in the well completion, and a fiber-optic cable was run to identify possible areas of the leak path. After the fiber-optic data acquisition, a production log was recorded across selective depths to provide an insight on leak paths. After identifying leak depths, a definitive decision between tubular patching and production system overhaul was decided based on combined outputs of the fiber-optic acquisition and production log.Results are presented for a well where multiple leaks were successfully identified using the novel operational approach. Further, operational time was reduced from 3 days (conventional slickline memory or e-line logging performed during daylight operation) to 1 day (a combination of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing and production log in a single run). The diagnosis of production system issues was completed in one shut-in and one flowing condition, thereby reducing the risk of HSE exposure with multiple flowing conditions (to simulate the leak while the conventional production logging tool is moved to different depths in the well). Additional insight on leak quantification was confirmed from the production log data, where one leak was noted at the tubing collar while the other leak was noted a few meters above the tubing collar. This observation was substantial in deciding whether to proceed with tubing patch or replace the entire production tubing.The novel operational approach affirms fiber-optic distributed temperature measurement's versatility in solving critical issues of operation time and reducing HSE exposure while delivering decisive information on production system issues. The paper serves as a staging area for other applications of similar nature to unlock even wider horizons for distributed temperature sensing measurement.}",

    abstract = "{In northern Mexico, from the Burgos basin to the Chicontepec field, horizontal wells have been a viable choice for exploiting hydrocarbons in tight gas and shale reservoirs. Successful drilling and completion of such wells has allowed goals in this complex operation to be reached. The learning curve trend means good knowledge has been acquired and difficulties encountered during completions can be addressed using new techniques available within the area.To achieve high performance when fracturing multiple zones, the application of an abrasive perforating technique using coiled tubing (CT) has proven a very effective alternative for acquiring optimum results. This has been particularly true for applications in highly deviated and horizontal wells. Although this technique has been applied in others regions since 1998, its implementation within this region has only become more common during the past three years.Using field experience with actual cases, this paper illustrates the available technologies and techniques that have become a new process in this region. Because of the undisputed completion and production results, pinpoint multistage fracturing is becoming the preferred completion technique used by the operator and will be used extensively as more horizontal wells are scheduled to be drilled and completed in upcoming years. Similarly, this has been the preferred choice when the formation is estimated to produce liquids.}",

    abstract = "{The current results of development of a new production logging (PL) tool based on an azimuthally distributed array of thermal anemometers and aimed at determination of inflow profiles beyond the limits of common mechanical sensors in horizontal wells producing oil and water at low rates are described in this paper.Theoretical background, implementation technique, and experimental prototype (EXP) were developed for the PL tool using azimuthally distributed thermo-anemometer (TA) sensors to obtain a dataset characterizing the production regime in low-rate (below 150 m3/d) oil and water horizontal wells.The new PL tool's TA sensors record overheating profiles along a well that depend on the local velocity of the fluid and its phase composition. The periodic heating regime of the TA sensors enabled measuring the undisturbed fluid temperature for determination of overheating and acquiring high-resolution temperature profiles, thus providing a valuable additional dataset of diagnostic attributes for characterization of the inflow.Laboratory testing allowed determination of calibration dependencies of TA signals versus velocities of single-phase water and oil flows. The calibrations were used for interpretation of data obtained with the PL tool and evaluation of the distribution of fluid phases for cross sections along a well and profiles of phase velocities. These results indicated the new tool's potential for implementation with a standard PL toolstring in low-rate oil and water horizontal wells.Interpretation of the EXP data together with that from standard PL tools enhanced the reliability of the determination of inflow zone intervals, phase composition of an inflowing fluid, and phase distribution of producing fluid along a well.Analysis of the field data established that effective resolution of temperature measurements by the new PL tool is approximately 0.015 K to enable registration of the effective fluid velocity in range of 0.5 to 15 m/min with corresponding resolution of 0.01 to 0.3 m/min to result in a spatial resolution of 1 to 20 m of the recorded parameters for uniform inflow along a horizontal wellbore. The evaluated values of spatial resolution are based on optimized logging speed, taking into account TA measurement specifics, well construction design, and total production rate.In this first field test of the innovative EXP in two horizontal wells producing water and oil at low rates, the tool was conveyed on coiled tubing and tractor. Joint interpretation of data recorded with the EXP and standard PL tools confirmed that the inflow profiles for each well along with profiles of phase velocities and water inflow zones were reliably established.}",

    abstract = "{The objective of this article is to share development progress and recent field examples for a new interpretation workflow enabling full integration of distributed dynamic thermal anemometry (TA) measurement data with the traditional workflow for production logging (PL) data analysis. A major focus is on oil-water inflow profiling in relatively low-rate horizontal wells.The dynamic azimuthally distributed thermal anemometry (ADTA) tool was recently field tested in several wells as a part of the PL assembly. The collected data sets and accumulated interpretation experience were used to develop a new workflow to make ADTA an intrinsic part of the data interpretation workflow. It includes a set of enhanced algorithms and software tools that provide automated calculation of the key parameters derived from TA data analysis along with traditional logs. The enhanced workflow is partially based on previously published laboratory experimental data and on utilization of collected field data interpretation experience.The newly developed algorithms and software tools enabled proving that results of the distributed TA data analysis are fully consistent with other PL data sets provided that the wellbore conditions and procedures enable high-quality measurements and interpretation. For such cases we demonstrate that profiles of multiphase inflows and wellbore phase fractions derived from the distributed TA agree reasonably well with interpretation of the spinner data, the distributed (volumetric) water-cut meter, and other PL data. Meanwhile, in cases of more challenging downhole conditions when some of the traditional PL measurements become unreliable, the distributed TA data can still provide interpretable and valuable information on the zonal inflow profiling. We discuss the uncertainty level for both cases: when all major PL data sets are available with good quality along with TA and in more challenging conditions with just a few reliable data sets. We conclude that integration of distributed TA data for quantitative analysis in multiphase wells extends PL capabilities toward more challenging wellbore conditions than previously possible.We discuss unique data sets of distributed TA data along with other PL data in the same wells and their quantitative analysis. The field examples of the fully integrated quantitative interpretation workflow are provided for horizontal wells with multiphase flow.}",
